## Setting up

Once you've cloned the repo, open a terminal in the root of the project and type `yarn`. This will install all dependencies and set up husky git hooks.

Copy/paste `.env.example` and rename it `.env`. This is a simple environment variable that sets the URL of the API for this demo, which is a publicly available API for testing.

You are now ready to run the application. Type `yarn dev` in the terminal to run the Next.js app, which is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Storybook

Type `yarn storybook` in the terminal to run Storybook, and explore the application and `.stories` files in the components folder.
